# reinforcement_learning_seminar

On July 8, 2021, a seminar about artificial intelligence was held at the Comenius University with Michal Chovanec PhD. <br/>
This seminar was focused on reinfrocement learning, reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning (Regular AI)  in not needing labelled input/output pairs be presented.<br/>
In this seminar, we learned the lunar lander to land on the moon without the player's help.<br/>
